# nyan-ScriptCraft
# S-Test 

This project is written in javaScript program using Minecraft ScriptCraft mode to simply build the nyan cat and the tail moves. 

Installation

1.Download ScriptCraft

2.Then cd to the resulting folder. Examples of scripts are in the directory scriptcraft/plugins/drone/contrib where you will see

        castle.js		hangtorch.js		redstonewire.js
        chessboard.js		lcd-clock.js		spawn.js
        cottage.js		logo.js			spiral_stairs.js
        dancefloor.js		mazegen.js		temple.js
        fort.js			rainbow.js

    You can use one of those as a model. Play some of the scripts to see how they work in the game.

3.Place nyan.js script in the same directory.

Start the server with go.sh (or the equivalent Windows one-liner)

From Minecraft you will see your server running on the local network.
Connect to it and test it with

/js 1+1

Then run nyan.js script with 

/js nyan()

Note that if you are on the same LAN, other team members can also connect to your server.
